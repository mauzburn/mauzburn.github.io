      <description>Data Wrangling and Exploration  Introduction The data that I acquired for this project was found on the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute’s website, where I honed in on county health rankings. Because I intend on going to medical school and eventually becoming a doctor, I found health data to be of particular interest. More than this, however, I am passionate about educating myself on health disparities seen across different groups in our countries.</description>

      <description>This dataset, obtained through the ‘fivethirtyeight’ database, outlines each case of police killings in the United States during the year of 2015. The variables I chose to include are particular to each victim of said police killings: age, race/ethnicity, armed (whether or not they possessed a weapon at the time of their murder), the percentage of the population that was white, black or hispanic/latino in the area that the shooting took place, median household income of the area, poverty rates of the area, and proportion of college graduates in the area.</description>
